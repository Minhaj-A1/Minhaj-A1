### Hi there, Minhaj here ðŸ‘‹

#### ðŸ¤” A bit about me
I am a graduate from the University of Cambridge with a Masters in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering. With an ever evolving digital world, I am keen on kickstarting my career in tech and have recently completed HyperionDev's Data Science bootcamp!
I am very interested in all things tech, including software engineering, data science, machine learning and also Artifical Intelligence. 

I am based in the UK but I am open to opportunities worldwide!

#### âš¡ Recent Projects
The most recent project I have completed is a data science project which involves conducting sentiment and similarity analysis on a dataset of Amazon product reviews. I have created a repo on it so make sure to check it out!

I am most familiar with Python as a programming language but I have also used some other languages during my degree including C++, MATLAB, and Fortran (I know, very obsolete)!

I am also currently learning SQL and hope to be learning many more techy things in the near future!
